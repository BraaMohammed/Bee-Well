## üöÄ The Story

I built Bee-Well as my first major solo project to learn full-stack development and solve a personal need: integrating daily planning with deep self-reflection. It was developed between March and August 2024 and served as the foundation for all my subsequent work.

While the code isn't perfect (I was learning!), this project proves my ability to architect and ship a feature-rich, user-focused application from concept to launch. It was the "training ground" where I made mistakes, learned, and grew into the developer I am today.

Specifically, building Bee-Well taught me the importance of:
* **Scalable State Management:** The prop-drilling in this app directly inspired me to adopt tools like Zustand and React Query in my later projects.
* **TypeScript:** Managing a growing JavaScript codebase here convinced me of the necessity of TypeScript for building robust, maintainable applications.
* **Backend Architecture:** I learned a great deal about data modeling and API design, which I later refined in my microservices-based projects.
